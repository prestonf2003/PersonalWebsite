            Hi Im ash and I don't have much experience with blogging but here I go. I started coding my freshman year of high school and it has been a real rollercoaster from feeling like the best coder in the world to feeling like a monkey could have developed that
            certain project more efficiently than I could have but recently mostly everything has started clicking in my head almost instantly when code alongs have been done which is what i credit my success to.

            <p>Ben Solo aka Kylo Ren had the potential to be the most powerful and skilled Jedi alright now I know that its a long shot and I just want y'all to hear me out okay lets look at the stats he had a 17700 midichlorian count which basically measures
                how close your connection and how strong your connection with the force is and for comparison Yodas is only slighty higher at 19000 and Lukes is the highest at 23000 at least for Jedi's If Luke had completed Bens Training sucessfully and
                with the right lightsaber combat style he could have easily defeated anyone in his path the problem with him and being turned to the dark side is that he then fought with emotion instead of logic and thank you for listening.
